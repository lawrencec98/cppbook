/*
    Modify class Link from ยง17.9.3 to be a template with the type of value as the template argument. Then redo Exercise 13 from Chapter 17 with Link<God>.

    Exercise 13:
        Modify the Link class to hold a value of a struct God. struct God should have members of type string: name, mythology, vehicle, and weapon. For example,
        God{"Zeus", "Greek", "", "lightning"} and God{"Odin", "Norse", "Eight-legged flying horse called Sleipner", "Spear called Gungnir"}.
        Write a print_all() function that lists gods with their attributes one per line. Add a member function add_ordered() that places its new element
        in its correct lexicographical position. Using the links with the values of type God, make a list of gods from three mythologies; then move the elements
        (gods) from that list to three lexicographically ordered lists - one for each mythology.
