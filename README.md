# stroustrup-book-ppp2

This repository contains end-of-chapter drills and exercises from Bjarne Stroustup's [Programming Principles and Practice using C++ Second Edition](https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html)

## Motivation for creating this repository
I started working through this textbook on December 18th 2023, as my very first introduction to the C++ Programming language. Prior to this book I have been self-learning programming since October 2023, touching on foundational concepts of C and Python. My goal at the end of this book is to know the technicalities of C++ from beginner to intermediate level, as well as to gain understanding of the broader view of programming.

## Notes
During exercises, I might be aware of more efficient techniques for cleaner code. However, I'll generally stick to the methods covered in the book up to each exercise.

Note that I've skipped some exercises in this book. This was done as I feel some of the topics are better practiced through projects / experience, provided I've understood the underlying theory. I would also like to progress through this book at a fairly lively pace in order to get started on said real-world applications.
