## [Completed]

This repository contains end-of-chapter drills and exercises from Bjarne Stroustup's [Programming Principles and Practice using C++ Second Edition](https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html)

## Motivation for creating this repository
I started this textbook on December 18 2023, as an introduction to C++.

Prior to this book I have been learning programming since October 2023, touching on foundational concepts in {Computer Science, C, and Python}.

My goal upon finishing this book is to know technicalities of C++ at a beginner-intermediate level, as well as gain understanding of the broader view of programming and software engineering.
