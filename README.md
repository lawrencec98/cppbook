# stroustrup-book-ppp2

This repository contains end-of-chapter drills and exercises from Bjarne Stroustup's [Programming Principles and Practice using C++ Second Edition](https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html)

## Motivation for creating this repository
I started working through this textbook on December 18th 2023, as my very first introduction to the C++ programming language. Prior to this book I have been self-learning programming since October 2023, touching on foundational concepts of Computer Science, C and Python. My goal at the end of this book is to know the technicalities of C++ from beginner to intermediate level, as well as to gain understanding of the broader view of programming.
